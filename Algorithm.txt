Intialize counter for number of persons inside the room as zero.
Make the pins to which the two light sensors connected as input.
Make the pin to which the relay connected as output and output zero to the pin to turn off relay initially (Assuming no one in the room.).
Enable INT1 and INT2 interrupts.
Wait for interrupt ie. for signal at INT1 or INT2 pins representing entrance or departure.

When a person enters the room, INT1 is received:
	Increment the counter.
	If counter is greater than 1 ie. if there is atleast one person in the room, turn on the relay to turn on lights.
	Clear INT1 flag.
	Return to wait state.
	
When a person leaves the room, INT2 is received:
	If counter is greater than zero ie. if there was atleast one person in the room, decrement the counter.
	If counter is equal to zero ie. if there is no one left in the room, turn off the relay to turn off lights.
	Clear INT2 flag.
	Return to wait state.
